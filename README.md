## How to Run

1.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

2.  Make sure Docker is running and pull the cellquant image from Docker Hub.  **You only need to do this once!**

`docker pull odonnelllab/pm-detection-demo`

3.  Run the following command to create a container and run on port 3838.  The -v flag maps the container directories with the local file system.

`docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 -v $HOME:/srv/shiny-server/home odonnelllab/pm-detection-demo`

The program will be running on localhost:3838.

A detailed installation tutorial for Docker and CellQuant is available [here](Tutorial/CellQuant-Installation-Instructions.pdf).


PMDetectionDemo is also included as part of the CellQuant [bundled release](https://github.com/sah129/CellQuant/releases/tag/v0.8-alpha).
